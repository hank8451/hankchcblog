Today, I launched my blog using Hugo and Github Pages. I aim to update it every two weeks! ðŸ˜€
Additionally, I hope to secure a custom domain by my next post.

Btw. I found a bug(?) where I can't overwrite my avatar in the landing page if the new file has the same name as the old one. When I tried, it just displayed the original avatar. To work around this, I had to use a different file name.
