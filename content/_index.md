## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Hello world, I'm Hank.

I started my blog for two main reasons: first, my memory isn't great and life moves too quickly to truly taste;
second, I often find it challenging to clearly express my knowledge of backend development.

Thank you for visiting, hope you enjoy your time here!
